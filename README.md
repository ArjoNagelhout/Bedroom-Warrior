# GGJ2019
A game made for the Global Game Jam 2019 @HKU, using GameMaker:Studio 2


## Story
The theme for this years' Global Game Jam was "What does home mean to you."

Home is a place where you feel safe. There are no threats. In this game, you play as a child that is scared for the dark in their own room. Help defeat their fears, in quite a literal sense, to make them feel safe again.
